1. "values added: 20"
2. "final result: 20"
3. "values added: 20"
4. The code will return an error because result is declared using the 'let' keyword, which only allows the variable to be used within its block.
5. The code will return an error becuase result is declared using the 'const' keyword, which disallows the variable to have its value change after it has been first assigned. Since result is assigned the value '0' on the same line it's declared, it cannot be reassigned a value on line 7.
6. Same as question 5.
